This was a simple library App that was created basically from scratch with the concert of Object Oriented Programming. 
i created a user interface where books could be added and deleted from the list of the books.
Then a search input fiels that would filter books that are searched for
By Adding books we are automatically creating newBooks which is a constructor fucntion making instances of itself and adding the books to an array(myLibrary)
Then by Deleting books the leave the book list stack and get popped out automatically from the array.
